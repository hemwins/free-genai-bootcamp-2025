In the current architecture of the Haiku Image Muse application, there's no traditional separation between backend and frontend as it's built as a client-side only application.
Current Architecture
Frontend

    React components for UI rendering (src/components/*)
    State management with React hooks
    User interaction handling
    API calls to external services (Hugging Face)
    The entire application runs in the browser

"Backend-like" Functionality

    The application doesn't have a traditional backend server
    Database operations are handled client-side using SQL.js (SQLite in the browser)
    Data is persisted using the browser's localStorage
    External API calls are made directly from the browser to Hugging Face

This architecture is what's known as a "serverless" or "client-side only" application where traditional backend services are replaced by:

    Browser-based storage (SQLite via SQL.js and localStorage)
    Direct API calls to third-party services (Hugging Face)

How to Run the App

To run the application:

    npm run dev

    Access the application at http://localhost:8080

Debugging

Since there's no separate backend server, you can debug the entire application using browser developer tools:

    Use the Console for logging
    Use the Network tab to monitor API calls to Hugging Face
    Use the Application tab to inspect localStorage and IndexedDB storage
