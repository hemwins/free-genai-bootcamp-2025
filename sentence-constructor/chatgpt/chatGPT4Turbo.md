#### assistant output:
    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | romaji | katakana |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | kuma | クマ |
    | door | tobira  | トビラ |
    | garbage | gomi  | ゴミ |
    | to be (location) | desu  | デス |
    | to leave |nokosu | ノコス |

#### Sentence structure:
    Here is an example of simple sentence structures.
- The bird is black. → [Subject] [Adjective].
- The raven is in the garden. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? → [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? → [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Object] [Verb]?
 -The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
 -I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].

#### Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action
    - try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
    - talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.

#### Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation

user: Did you see butterflies this morning? They were in our garden.
