#### assistant output:
    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | romaji | katakana |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | kuma | クマ |
    | door | tobira  | トビラ |
    | garbage | gomi  | ゴミ |
    | to be (location) | desu  | デス |
    | to leave |nokosu | ノコス |

#### Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

#### Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

#### Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
