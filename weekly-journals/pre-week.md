## Hypothesis and Technical Uncertainties

Hypothesis:-
The heart of teaching remains human. AI-Powered Assistants will not replace real teachers but will excel in support rolesâ€”handling routine tasks, offering personalized practice, or providing extra support.

Technical Uncertainties:-
1. How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?
- Broad tasks often require a deeper understanding of context, nuances, and specific domain, which is challenging for current AI assistants.
2. Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
- Yes, whenever instead of opening a new conversation I tried to continue my conversation while adding on just one another feature in my requirements, these assistants performed well. 
3. Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?
- I think so. It supports quick testing of different instructional strategies.
4. How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
- Sorry, I don't understand it yet.	
5. How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?
- Not much. Free versions of these AI assistants are more or less the same. In paid versions the context window size would affect the prompting document.
6. What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?
- role playing, contextual anchoring, formatting output and Few-shot learning.
7. Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?
- Claude: what I learned from video that they are very good at identifying subtle nuances in Japanese grammar patterns.   MetaAI: Though it needs more structured guidance but it is based on open model and hence would be highly customizable if self-hosted.
8. What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?
-Got a glimpse of how to provide and refine our prompt document to these assistants. Learnt to balance performance with cost-effectiveness.

## Technical Exploration

1. I was tempted to use Kumaoni language as I want to learn it, but I got to know that it would be a very tough task because of these reasons:
1.1 Since no model supports Kumaoni, It would be a two step process. English->Hindi->Kumaoni
1.2 If I would choose to use mBART, mT5 Hugging Face models, which support multi languages, still fine-tuning these models on Kumaoni data might be challenging due to data scarcity.
So, the model won't be performing well to be used as a teaching assistant for the language. 
2. I am new to GenAI and don't know Kumaoni as well, so I decided to stick with Japanese. By choosing Japanese I could follow along the tutorial videos and learnt about different prompting techniques and also understanding and using Github.
3. In case of Github once I made a mistake of not staging the files to be uploaded. But then I learned about it more.
4. I had never made any conceptual diagrams. For the first time I explored Lucidchart, draw.io and PlantUML. Not only tools but also got to know about various types of diagrams and various moving parts of a system.

## Final Outcomes
1. I learned few-shot prompting and direct context injection in my query for various AI assistants. For the first time, I noticed their architecture and parameters.
2. I saw Andrew making projects and using different xml files to distribute the context. I do not have paid version so I could not practice it.
3. My confusions around Hugging Face got cleared. 
4. Practiced writing better prompt with MetaAI, ChatGPT and Claude.
5. During this week my understanding around ML and AI improved because of wonderful resources shared by you. 
6. I learnt new tools and new concepts this week.

7. Also, I am planning to work on my Kumaoni language teacher project after completing this bootcamp as I would have familiarity with GenAI and project making in this bootcamp. So, I have broken down my technical problem of not knowing GenAI and not knowing Kumaoni in two smaller problems- first learn GenAI models and then finetune it for Kumaoni language.
